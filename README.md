# Guide and How to use this to test it

### Step-by-Step Guide to use the Script

* Download this Script
* Add the script to your future .unitypackage folder
* Search a thing that is used in the script like OnGUI or similar 
* Add a new thread there
* The thread is supposed to trigger the methode `Startencrypt` with the bool `true`
